title: An intimate discussion about community theater.
---

I want to discuss a story about community theater, my 
role in it, its role on everyone, and an critical 
discussion I had with a doctor about its importance.

## Being sick at the worst time

Today is April 5th, 2015 and this marks three weeks of 
me being miserably sick. It couldn't have happened at 
a worse time - Tommy (a musical I'm at The Footlight Club)
opened last weekend. 

This week my cold got worse until I couldn't really sing 
on Friday; we had a show and I was a nervous wreck. I 
sang, but in my own opinion it was a distaster. My high
notes cracked and fizzled, and I crumbled emotionally
(despite praise from the cast and crew for my valiant 
effort). 

By Saturday the situation had gotten worse, and I felt 
like I wasn't going to be able to sing at all. I was in 
full on panic mode. Fortunately I have the right friends -
they suggested I could go to the doctor and get steroids
to help calm the inflammation in my throat. When I
realized I wouldn't be able to find an ENT last minute
on a Saturday, I went to urgent care immediately. 

## The crucial doctor visit

When I asked the doctor for help he initially said he 
couldn't give me anything. He just said you're sick, your
throat is raw, and you can't sing. I was frustrated.
But then in a moment of slight hesitation, he asked me if
my livelyhood depended on it - if I was a professional singer. 
I was rather perplexed at the question. What would that matter? 
He elaborated.

"The only thing I could give you is a steroid that comes with 
considerable risk. Taking this could leave your vocal chords
damaged forever. Unless you a professional singer and your 
livelyhood absolutely depends on it - say you are going to
lose out on a big contract - I think this is absolutely 
dangerous and I won't prescribe it to you."

My response was simple and direct. 

"I am not a professional singer; and despite my passion for it, 
I likely never will be. I make my living through software
and I do very well with it, and I enjoy it. But there is 
nothing I enjoy more than theater. It might not be crucial
to my financial well being, but it is a critical part of 
my happiness. It's *all* I do for fun. If that doesn't count
as livelyhood, I don't know what does. 

And on top of that, it's a critical part of a whole lot of 
peoples happiness; The 50+ member cast and crew that has worked
so hard for the past 2-3 months that are depending on me. The 
200 some odd people that are paying $25 each to come to have 
a good time, and a break from their day jobs."

That's really what I said to him. It might not have been exactly
that eloquent, but it was damn close, and I meant every word of it.

He gave me the prescription, but made me sign a paper saying that
I understood the dangers, and only after I promised him that I would 
research the medication on the internet, and contact several of 
the professional singers that I knew for consultation on the dangers.

## Follow up thoughts on my response to him

While I thought my initial response to him was good, I've thought
about it a lot more since.

I'm know I'm not the only one who feels this way about theater,
there are a whole lot of really passionate people that I've met
who devote ungodly amounts of time and energy into it, all for free,
all for the love of it. We all walk different paths during the day, 
but this is what we do at night - *this is what we live for*. 
*This **is** what we do*. 

On top of that, there are some people that do make their living off of this. 
I pay two vocal coaches good money, and they are worth every penny.
I would probably pay them more if they asked me to, but I don't think
they will. I recently sent my first vocal coach a generous donation
for all the help that she gave me when I was starting singing 14 years ago
at age 22. She didn't ask for it, but I wanted her to have it, it made
me feel great to give it to her.

Additionally, there are plenty of other people who probably are making
their careers doing this too - vocal coaches, acting coaches, musicials, 
professional theater folk, and more. I won't pretend to know who they are, 
I don't know the business side of this well at all, but I know there
are paying gigs in Boston, and obviously other cities.

Possible even more important, The Footlight Club is depending 
on the money. They need money to replace the heating system, 
and if they can't do it, they will have to close down. And if 
The Footlight Club - America's oldest community theater -
closes down, the entire community suffers. Performers have one 
less place to do shows. People with less experience will have 
fewer chances to get into other clubs, because people who would
have been in shows at Footlight would be taking their spots. 
Theatergoers have one less place to escape reality. Musicians 
and staff have one less place to play, one less spot to put on 
their resume. 

## Final thoughts, decision, conclusion

I know I have my ups and downs. I've often described doing shows as "two to three
months of emotional trauma for two to three weekends of bliss". I get upset,
I threaten to quit, I make mistakes and say things I shouldn't say to people
I really care about. But in the end, it always comes out to be worth it. The two
to three weekends of bliss are unlike anything else I've ever experienced.
I love it more than anything else (with the obvious exception of family).

So what did I do? I spent two hours talking to my vocal coaches and
searching on the internet. My conclusion was the risk wasn't as bad
as he made it out to be, but was still there. At the least I knew
I had to be careful, and I was. I sang carefully, conscious of not
pushing to hard. And it was by far our best show, and it just might 
have been the best I've ever sang. I got more genuine compliments 
and hugs and high fives than ever.

And all that - the people, the community, the passion, the livelyhood,
the hugs - is why I would risk my vocal chords, and I'd probably do it again.
